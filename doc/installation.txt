Installation:

1. Configure docker-compose.yml:

    Set in SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON

    server.host - you server hostname
    server.port - you server port
    restreamer.playlist.url - playlist url (where to download playlist from)
    restreamer.origin.streamer.address - origin streamer address (host:port), may include path (host:port/some_path)

        volumes:
            source: /host/some_location/hls_path - where to store downloaded chunks
    (mount here tmpfs on host for performance)

    Instead of using restreamer.playlist.url you could place
    manually modified playlist named playlist.json to directory
        source: /host/some_location/hls_path

    If restreamer found here file playlist.json it will use this playlist instead trying download new one.

2. Run using start.sh
